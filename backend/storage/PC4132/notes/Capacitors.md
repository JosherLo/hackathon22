# Capacitors

Capacitors usually consist of parallel plates of conducting substances, usually metals, separated by an air gap or an insulator known as a dielectric.

The defining feature of a capacitor is its capacitance, denoted by C, which is the ratio of the charge stored on the plates of the capacitor to the voltage across the plates. This value is determined solely by the geometry of the capacitor.

For a simple parallel plate capacitor, its capacitance is given by the formula C = Îµo A / d, where A is the area of the plates and d is the distance between them. This formula only holds when d << sqrt(A).
