# Magnetostatics

When a steady current is passed through a wire, a magnetic field is generated which circulates around the wire.

This magnetic field can then exert a force on moving charges or currents, with the direction of the force acting according to the right hand rule.

For two current-carrying wires placed parallel to each other, they will repel each other if their currents point in opposite directions, and will attract if their currents flow in the same direction.
