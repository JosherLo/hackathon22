Positive charges repel, so the electric field will always point away from positive charges and towards negative charges."}]},{"tags":["Electrostatics"],"title":"Solve for the full electric field around a parallel plate capacitor","asker":"StudentE","markdown":"We were always taught that a parallel plate capacitor has no electric field outside it, but there must be some electric fields at the edges.
