# Flow

A website for your workflow.

An integrated solution designed for NUSH students to aid in their learning, through collaboration with their peers.

## Main Features

### Group Projects

Students will be able to create groups and invite their peers to join them. They can then create projects and assign tasks to their group members.

This feature includes a general overview of the project, as well as a timeline and a table with a checklist to keep group members on task.

To access the rest of the feature, one must first join a class. The class password and name will be provided to the student.

### Shared Notes

A student will be able to access the notes of the class, add their own notes, and add to existing notes, aiding their studying process by putting information in one place.

First, the class must be selected. After that, the student can filter the notes for that class through tags or search for a specific note.

Students who find a certain note helpful can upvote it, so that the best notes appear first and are more easily accessible.

### Forum

A student will be able to ask questions and answer questions, aiding their learning process by allowing them to ask questions and get answers from their peers.

The forum will be free of assistance from teachers, allowing students to learn independently at their own pace and clarify doubts.

It will also have a voting system similar to that of the shared notes, to further encourage participation.

### Leaderboard

Each class will have its own leaderboard, which ranks students based on their participation in the above categories through a scoring system.

This system is not meant to be competitive, instead built to incentivise students to actively participate in all aspects of the website.
